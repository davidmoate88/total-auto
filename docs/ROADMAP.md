# Roadmap

The long-term goal (from the original brief): a toolkit covering as much of a
"head of project design" role as can be sensibly automated — engineering review,
portfolio tracking, and information/communication flow — with everything else made
as efficient as possible.

## Milestone 1 — Engineering calculation framework (in progress)

- [x] Core framework: calc input/result models, registry pattern, markdown report
      generator.
- [x] First module: geotechnical shallow foundation bearing capacity (Meyerhof).
- [ ] Second geotechnical calc (e.g. settlement, or retaining wall) to prove the
      framework generalises within a discipline.
- [ ] First structural calc module (e.g. simply-supported beam capacity check).
- [ ] PDF export of the review sheet (currently markdown only).

## Milestone 2 — Meeting minutes → actions

- [ ] Ingest a transcript (text file to start).
- [ ] Extract structured minutes: attendees, topics, decisions.
- [ ] Extract actions with owner + due date.
- [ ] Reminder mechanism (initially: exportable task list; later: scheduled nudges).

## Milestone 3 — Project portfolio dashboard

- [ ] Data model for a project: cost, time/programme, buildability notes, constraints,
      risks, contacts, feasibility status.
- [ ] Import from spreadsheet trackers.
- [ ] Portfolio-level view: status across all live projects, flagged risks/constraints.

## Milestone 4 — Information flow (email / comms triage)

- [ ] Connector to inbox (Outlook/Gmail) once available.
- [ ] Summarize + prioritize incoming project emails.
- [ ] Draft responses for routine items.

## Design decisions log

- **Framework over one-off scripts**: every calc module follows the same
  input/calculate/result/report shape so the eventual dashboard and report tooling
  work uniformly across disciplines, instead of bespoke code per calc.
- **Streamlit for the UI**: fastest way to get a real usable interface without
  committing to a heavier web stack before the shape of the full tool is known. Easy
  to replace later if the project grows into something needing a proper frontend.
- **Markdown reports first, PDF later**: markdown is enough to prove the "review-ready
  output" pattern; PDF export is a formatting layer on top, not a redesign.
